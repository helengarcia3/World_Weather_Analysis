# World_Weather_Analysis

##Overview
PlanMyTrip app is changing the way we travel by combining things like weather, destination and lodging to build a route for your next Vacation. We will build a travel route between four citites and identify potential destinations and hotels.

##Deliverable 1
Generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap.

##Deliverable 2
Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map by retreiving customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.


##Deliverable 3

Use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
